Internet is basically a collection of computer networks.

## How did the internet start?
Basically they had multiple sites for development of satellites and needed them to communicate with each other. They were at MIT, UCLA, Stanford, Utah. the computers used [[TCP]] to communicate with each other. And eventually enough computers got added and it lead to the creation of **WWW(world wide web)**. 

## [[Network Protocols]]
basically a set of rules that dictate how data is sent over the internet. [[TCP]] is one. like for example for a certain protocol the network has to make sure that 100% of the data is delivered. for another, it might be fine to drop a few bits and pieces.
