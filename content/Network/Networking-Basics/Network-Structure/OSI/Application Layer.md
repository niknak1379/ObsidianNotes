* Hosts user interactions
* WhatsApp, browser, etc...
* Where: Device
* [[Network Protocols]]
* Client Server Architecture

The ways applications are connected to each other:
	1. Client Server Architecture
	2. Peer to Peer(P2P)
		1. Every computer is both a client and a server. 


Applications are Processes which are made of threads:

Sockets: Interface between a process and the internet. 
Ports: So each process is going to be listening on its own port(like each instance of chrome has its own part), using **Ephemeral Ports**. 
	Ephemeral Ports: temporary ports assigned by a OS during a communication session.
