[[Common JS modules]]
	uses `requrie()` to pull in modules
		require is **synchronous**, meaning everything should happen instantly 
[[ES modules]]
	uses `import export` statements
		u can import Common js modles with this, but you cannot use common js to import ES modules, unless you use `await` statements and turn it into async
