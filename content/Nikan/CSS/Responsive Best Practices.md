Doing min height to make sure that on very big screens the content doesnt get really spread out.
and doing max-width with and margin-inline: auto; so that a container is centered on the screen.

avoid view port units, might cause overflow becuase it counts the scroll bars as a part of the view port, so might introduce horizantal scroll bars
