[[img element]]: 
		always use alt text
			good practice to add a period at the end to make the screen reader to a small pause
		background images and decorative images or images used for spacing should have an empty alt attribute so that they are skipped
			if no alt attribute included the screen reader will read the file name instead which can be confusing 
			 icons should also have an empty alt attribute
	[[<a>]] links have to be descriptive 
		if you want to make an entire section clickable its best to put an empty link inside and change the dimensions of the tag using [[position: absolute]]
		add hover effect to links and clickable items
