What it is: 
	A way to tap into a system's event, you push data into a system when it is necessary.
Why do we have them:
	basically so you don't overwhelm an API to see if an update has happened in the state of whatever ur trying to check.


its probably important for [[Event Driven Architecture(EDA)]]
