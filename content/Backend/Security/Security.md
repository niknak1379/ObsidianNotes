### HTTPS
HTTP is in plain text so passwords and other stuff can be easily intercepted
HTTPS makes it unreadable 
### SSL
### TLS - Transport Layer Security
TLS handshake:
browser sends client hello to the server
Server sends a hello back and a certificate including a public key back to the browser
Public key is used in **Asymmetric Encryption**. ( data encrypted by the pubic key can only be decrypted by the private key).
Key exchange: shared encryption key to encrypt data (assymetric encription)
but computationaly
