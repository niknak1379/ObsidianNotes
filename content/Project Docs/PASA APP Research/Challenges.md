[[Intersection Observer]]
The algorithm for activating and deactivating the nav bar links for the section of the website that is being displayed is very annoying, not sure how to actually do it. 

**never mind apparently theres already an INTERSECTIONOBSERVER api backed in i couldve used**

it also has a threshold function for how much of the element is in the view port hwich is nice but doesnt really work out well for really long vertical carousels which unfortunately i have one in this page. Ended up scrapping the feauture bc of that, it was taking too much time

also couldve just used this api instead of the js and height stuff i wrote by myself.
