title: Welcome to Nikan's Vault
---
Hi!! This is my Obsidian Vault that is being hosted on Github Pages, and is built using the Quartz 4 HTML builder! You can access my notes and `.md` files using the explorer widget on this page. The notes are updated early using a [[Cron Jobs]] job that pushes the repo to git using an Github [[Repo SSH]] key
See the [documentation](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz) for how to set up ur own Quartz website!
